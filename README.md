# MAHJONG-GAME-WITH-SOUNDS-IN-MATLAB

I designed a Mahjong game with sound effects as a school project.

In this Mahjong game, players are tasked with matching pairs of identical tiles from a shuffled board. The goal is to remove all tiles by finding and selecting matching pairs.

The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with a Mahjong board and game options, along with sounds linked to specific events to enhance the overall gaming experience.


# Installation Guide:

1) Downlaod and install Matlab. You need a Mathworks account for this.
2) Download app's files in the same folder.
3) Open the appm.mlapp. An Matlab App Designer window will appear.
4) You can run the game by clicking RUN (the green arrow).
5) ENJOY!
